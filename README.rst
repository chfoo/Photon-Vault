You can invoke the photonvault package like so::

    python -m photonvault.main config.conf

Then, open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000. You can now upload, edit, and browse photos. Other computers can connect as well. There is no login system in place; anyone can edit the photos.

Changelog
+++++++++

Version 1.2
-----------

 * Duplicates will be detected by date and filename during processing. This occurs for new files that are uploaded. 
   * Fingerprints are the first 4 bytes of a MD5 hash of {the lowercased filename and the ISO8601 date} concatenated with the last two bytes of the lowercased filename without an extension. This method is suited for JPEG files named like IMAGE_123456.jpg. Using truncated hashes of filenames and dates allows the fingerprint to be short and fast to compute which should be sufficient for home usage.
 * Will not crash on start up if the database isn't ready yet

Version 1.1
-----------

 * Support deleting photos through Manage
 * Improved navigation

Version 1.0
-----------

First release to support upload, editing, tagging, and browsing.
